# About Featured Content{#featured-content}

Highlight important content to your users by using CSS to custom style Featured content.

Any piece of content in a Collection can be tagged as “featured” by your network site owners or moderators, in order to highlight important content and encourage high quality replies from other users. Once a piece of content has been featured, a  tag will be displayed on the content in the app, so that users can easily identify content that owners and moderators have highlighted.**[!UICONTROL Featured]**

In Comments:

* The two most recent pieces of  content will also be pulled above the stream.**[!UICONTROL Featured]**
* It may take up to seven minutes for Featured content to appear above the editor.
* A  tag may be added to any comment within the stream, and used to style the comment, but only Livefyre-native user generated content will appear above the editor.**[!UICONTROL Featured]**

When content is unfeatured, the  tag displayed will be removed in real-time.**[!UICONTROL Featured]**

Once a piece of content has been featured, a  badge will be displayed on the content in the app, and you may use the fyre-featured CSS class to custom style the content.**[!UICONTROL Featured]**
